**_Elegant implementations of Elegant algorithms._**

*"For me, great algorithms are the poetry of computation. Just like verse, they can be terse, allusive, dense, and even mysterious. But once unlocked they cast a brilliant new light on some aspect of computing."*

The above quote by Francis Sullivan sums it all.

If you have a more elegant solution for an algorithm, please contribute.
