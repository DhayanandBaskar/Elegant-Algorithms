**_Elegant implementations of Elegant algorithms._**

**Quote by Francis Sullivan:**
*"For me, great algorithms are the poetry of computation. Just like verse, they can be terse, allusive, dense, and even mysterious. But once unlocked they cast a brilliant new light on some aspect of computing."*

If you have a more elegant implementation for an algorithm, please do contribute. Contributions are welcome for algorithms that are not yet present in this repository.
